My first readme
It has been a wonderful time coding! 
I have learnt alot and it amazes me how quickly I am learning. 
It has not been all rosy though cos I developed some headache trying to crack the previous project -Project 3. 
I have made alot of changes to the master branch. In one case, js was was deleted while the contain of alx was changed.
I delivered on all of these and I cannot be happier!
Thanks again to ALx for this visionary impact!
